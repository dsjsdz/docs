# Merchant

## Apply or Create merchant

First, you must be a newly registered user. You can either create a new merchant account or join an existing merchant
group.

A new merchant account will be created and reviewed by an administrator before it becomes active.

If you wish to join an existing merchant, you’ll need an invitation code provided by that merchant. The invitation code
is valid for 12 hours.
